			<p>The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by Gibson Guitar Corporation in 1952. The Les Paul was designed by Ted McCarty who later enlisted 
				popular guitarist Les Paul, to endorse the new model. Although Les later claimed to have been intimately involved in the design of the guitar, it is now generally 
				accepted that the guitar was substantively designed by McCarty and his team with Les' contributions being limited to the initial gold finish on the top and the 
				short-term implementation of the ill-fated Les Paul trapeze tailpiece. It is one of the best-known electric guitar types in the world, along with the Gibson SG, 
				as well as Fender's Telecaster and Stratocaster.</p>

				<li><strong>Les Paul Studio: </strong>Originally released in 1983, the Les Paul Studio's stripped-down ethos offers a less ornate, yet genuine American-made

				<li><strong>Les Paul Traditional Pro II: </strong>The Les Paul Traditional Pro II gives you to-die-for vintage looks and feel with added coil-splitting and 
						an onboard user-adjustable 10dB boost for a versatile array of incredible humbucking and single-coil tones.</li>

						upgrades including an asymmetrical SlimTaper neck profile, coil-splitting, phase reversal and a Pure Bypass switch.</li>
				<li><strong>Les Paul Traditional: </strong>With all the fat, sweet, snarling Les Paul tone that purists love, the Traditional plays, sounds and feels like
